# Nodejs Web Application

Basic Web Application built using Nodejs, Express and Handbrake templates. This application allows the following operations:
- View a 'Home Page'
- View a 'About Page'
- View a 'Projects Page'
- View a 'Error Page'

## Getting Started

Make sure you have Nodejs and npm installed on your machine.

Follow this link if unsure : https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm

### Installing

Run the following command from the nodejs-web-server directory to see how the system works:

node server.js and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to see how this all fits together - this is not a pretty app as I am not showcasing CSS but rather how a basic static website built with Nodejs fits together, and how easy this can be accomplished.
